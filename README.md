DejaVu Sans with added icons for window managers.

I was playing with my [dwm fork](https://github.com/epedroni/dwm) and decided I wanted fancy TTF icons, but didn't feel like manually patching in Pango support, so I threw together this font instead. It is a merge of DejaVu Sans and the icons from a few famous WMs taken from <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-font-icons/>.

It's completely built around my dwm preferences, so some of the icons have funny sizes and minor tweaks.
